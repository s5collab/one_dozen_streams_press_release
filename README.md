Caption: Artist representation of our Milky Way Galaxy surrounded by dozens of stellar streams. These streams were the companion satellite galaxies or globular clusters that are now being torn apart by our Galaxy’s gravity.

Caption: Location of the stars in the dozen streams as seen on the sky. The background shows the stars in our Milky Way from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission. The AAT is in a Southern Hemisphere telescope so only streams in the Southern sky are observed by S5.
